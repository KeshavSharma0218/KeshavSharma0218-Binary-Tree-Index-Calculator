# KeshavSharma0218-Binary-Tree-Index-Calculator
This Java program calculates the index of a given node ('A') in a binary tree represented by triples of characters. Each triple consists of a parent node and its left and right children. The program processes the tree and determines the index of node 'A' using a level-order traversal.

Features:
Parses a list of triples to construct a binary tree.
Computes the index of node 'A' based on its position in the tree.
Uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to calculate the index.
Instructions:
Input a list of space-separated triples representing the binary tree. Each triple consists of a parent node followed by its left and right children.
The program will output the index of node 'A' in the tree.
Example Input:
A BC B CD C --
Example Output:
0
